1) Data selection
I have seleccted data from Abs website (Australian bureau of  statistics) Employed persons by Industry group of main job (ANZSIC), Sex, State and Territory, November 1984 onwards (Pivot Table). 

- Cleaned the data according to the requrirement and generated few graphs to show insights from the data.
- I thought I can get better insights from data with Tableau and created an interactive dashboard includes Total employees by region, Employed in various industries with respect to region, five year growth of of employment region and growth by indutry. The Dashboard and sheets can be found in this link https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/ramdileepj.
